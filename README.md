## Scenario

The goal of this assignement is to modify given REST API written in express.js using typescript. Public API consist of 2 endpoints `[get]` `localhost:8000/exercises` (list of exercises) and `[get]` `localhost:8000/programs` programs (list of programs).

Structure of API responses

```javascript
{
    data: {
        id: 1
    }
    message: 'You have successfully created program'
}
```

or

```javascript
{
    data: [{
        id: 1,
        name: 'Program 1'
    }]
    message: 'List of programs'
}
```

## Task 1

Create authorization layer to enable users to access private API (next Task)

- create new db model User(name:string , surname: string, nickName:string, email: string, age: number, role:[ADMIN/USER])
- add authorization layer
- user can register using email, password and role (for purpose of this assignment, user can choose his role in registration)
- user can log in with email and password
- use proper way how to store user data
- you can use any authorization approach or npm module (preferred is JWT strategy and passport)

***

## Task 2

ADMIN can:

- create, update or delete exercises
- edit exercises in program (add or remove)
- get all users and all its data
- get user detail
- update any user (name, surname, nickName, age, nickName, role)

## Task 3

***

Create private API for user with role [USER]

USER can:

- get all users (id, nickName)
- get own profile data (name, surname, age, nickName)
- track exercises he has completed (he can track same exercise multiple times, we want to save datetime of completion and duration in seconds)
- see list of completed exercises (with datetime and duration) in profile
- remove tracked exercise from completed exercises list

USER cannot:

- access ADMIN API
- get or update another user profile

***

## Bonus task 1 - pagination, filter, search

Add pagination to exercise list using query => `/exercises?page=1&limit=10` return 1 page of exercises in maximal length of 10.

Add filter by program => `/exercises?programID=1` return only exercises of program with id = 1

add fultext search on exercise name => `/exercises?search=cis` => return only exercises which name consist of string `cis`
***

## Bonus task 2 - validation

Create validation service to check request body, query and params to make sure user sends valid request. For example, in registration, user must send valid email, otherwise return status code 400.
Also you can use validation on query in bonus task 1.

***

## Bonus task 3 - localization

Create localization service to send message attribute in API responses in correct language. Default language is EN, optional is SK. User can send all requests with HTTP header `language: 'sk'` or `language: 'en'` to receive required language localization.

example of response for request with `language: 'sk'`

```javascript
{
    data: {
        id: 1
    }
    message: 'Program bol úspešne vytvorený'
}
```

***

## Bonus task 4 - error handling

Create proper way how to handle all errors in application. Use console.error display error in terminal, user can never see stack trace or real error message. You can write error logs to file.

response status code >= 500

```javascript
{
    data: {}
    message: 'Something went wrong'
}
```
